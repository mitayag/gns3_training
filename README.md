# Training Description: Mastering GNS3 and Wireshark for Networking Education

## Overview
This **two-day training** is designed for faculty members of the **School of Computing** who teach Cisco and other networking subjects. The focus of this training is to provide educators with hands-on experience in using **GNS3** (Graphical Network Simulator-3) and **Wireshark**, two essential tools for teaching networking concepts effectively. Through a series of lab activities, participants will learn how to install, configure, and integrate GNS3 and Wireshark to simulate real-world networking scenarios, troubleshoot issues, and enhance student engagement.
